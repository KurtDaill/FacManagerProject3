This is a clothing picker which uses a bridge pattern. There are two Abstract classes, ClothingType and ClothingColor. 

These are then implemented inside of the various other classes, such as Pants, Shirt, Red, and Blue.

There can be more colors and clothing types that are able to be added.

They are then combined in the main when you make a ClothingType object with a color in its constructor.
